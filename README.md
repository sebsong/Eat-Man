# Eat-Man
My very first game created using ruby and gosu (a 2-d game development library for ruby).

Requires Gosu library.
To start the game, run the file main.rb using ruby: ruby main.rb
Arrow keys to move Eat Man.
Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 to change the song.
There may or may not be a cheat code... (Hint: U+0073)
