# Eat-Man
My very first game created using ruby and gosu (a 2-d game development library for ruby).

Link to install library: https://www.libgosu.org/

Requires Gosu library.

To start the game, run the file main.rb using ruby: ruby main.rb

Arrow keys to move Eat Man.

Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 to change the song.

There may or may not be a cheat code... (Hint: U+0073)
